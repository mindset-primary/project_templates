# project_templates

This repository is a pantry for storing templates for standard project structures.

Each template  functions as a scaffolding for a basic project setup which includes
directory structure and files.

A template is stored as a branch and can be directly used via the command line via 
cookiecutter https://github.com/mindset-primary/project_templates.git --checkout branchname
